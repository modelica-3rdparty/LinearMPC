# LinearMPC

Modelica library for model-based predictive controllers with linear process models.

## Library description

`LinearMPC` is a Modelica library for model-based predictive controllers with linear process models, which offers the use of several model representations in the controller for predicting the future plant outputs.

As well, the controller is capable of constraints and disturbance handling. A controller block can be included easily into any Modelica model and is parameterized intuitively.

The library avoids the coupling of Modelica to other software products. Thus, a contribution is made towards an integrated control system design in Modelica.
